Welcome to EnviroGen's User Manual
==================================

The [Enviro]ment [Gen]erator program.

EnviroGen is a utility package to create highly customised image stacks which can loaded as the environment for REvoSim runs. The package allows image stacks to be created using a number of different algorithms, and thus individual variables (e.g. rate of change, complexity) to be isolated and their impact on simulations studied. It also contains several convenience functions: for example, it allows noise image stacks to be created, two image stacks to be combined, uniform coloured stacks to be created, and a stack to be created from a single image.
