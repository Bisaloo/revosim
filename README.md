## 2. Introduction

REvoSim is an evolutionary model that aims to bridge the epistemological gap between micro- and macro-evolution; by providing an organism-level simulation of sufficient computational efficiency that population sizes of 10*5-10*6 individuals can be studied over geological timescales. The model also incorporates concepts of spatial relationships, spatial and temporal environmental variation, and recombinant reproduction. Isolation of gene-pools (i.e. speciation) is not enforced, but emerges naturally from simulations under appropriate conditions. We intend REvoSim as a multipurpose platform for the study of many evolutionary phenomena; while it was designed with macro-evolutionary studies in mind, it is also applicable to micro-evolutionary problems.

## 3. Installation

REvoSim may be compiled using QT from the source code or installed from the binary releases on our [GitHub](https://github.com/palaeoware).

_____

## 4. Minimum Requirments

REvoSim will run on any modern desktop/laptop: we recommend a minimum of 1GB RAM and a 1.8 GHz or faster, ideally multicore processor. We also recommend a minimum screen resolution of 1280x720 if using the software without the genome comparison docker (and 1920x1080 if this is enabled).

_____

## 5. Documentation

All documentation for REvoSim is online at [http://revosim.readthedocs.io/](http://revosim.readthedocs.io/). This is a version controlled user manual automatically parsed from the .rst found under the ./docs folder in our git root.
